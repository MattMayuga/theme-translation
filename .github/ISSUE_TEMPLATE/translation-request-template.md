**Target file**
One section per issue, please. If your issue spans multiple sections, please create separate issues.
Ex1. WAIEI CitMin
Ex2. Customs/TargetSetting

**Original Japanese text.**
Enclose it with &#0096;&#0096;&#0096; so that it becomes a CODE tag.
Ex.
```ini
[ScreenCustom]
NotFoundText=カスタム機能が見つかりません。 タイトル画面に戻ります。
LabelDescription=機能の説明
```

**Your recommended translation text.**
Please avoid internet slang and memes, and try to "translate" rather than "localize" as much as possible.
Ex.
```ini
[ScreenCustom]
NotFoundText=Custom data not found. Return to the title screen.
LabelDescription=Description
```
